<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> This measures the extent to which authors from different disciplines collaborate on research projects. It reflects the diversity of the prior disciplinary backgrounds of a paper’s co-authors and is calculated to account for the number of distinct disciplines, the cognitive distance that separates them, and the balance between them. A paper co-authored by authors whose previous papers were distributed across subfields of science in a similar pattern would score lower than papers bringing together authors with different backgrounds even if those authors, individually, have published in a less diverse set of subfields. Share of highly DDA (highly multidisciplinary) publications refers to the share of an entity’s papers among the top 10% with the highest DDA in the world. </marquee>
