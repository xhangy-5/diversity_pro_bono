        <h1><strong>Gender Diversity in Research: Dashboard Indicators</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Inter &amp; Multidisciplinary research indicators</h2>
        <p>Interdisciplinary research combines knowledge or methods from two or more academic disciplines into one activity (e.g., a research project). Interdisciplinary research is becoming increasingly important as many of the most pressing problems facing society today require solutions that draw on knowledge from multiple disciplines.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> To measure interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity, we use as proxies the disciplinary diversity of authors (DDA) and disciplinary diversity of references (DDR).</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Share of highly interdisciplinary publications: </strong>This measures the extent to which research publications cite sources from different disciplines, to reflect the diversity of knowledge that is being integrated into the publication (disciplinary diversity of references &ndash; DDR). It is computed based on the material cited by the publication. The indicator considers (a) the number of different subfields that are being cited, (b) the distribution of those citations across the cited subfields, and (c) the intellectual proximity of those subfields to one another. Share of highly interdisciplinary publications refers to the share of an entity&rsquo;s papers among the top 10% with the highest DDR in the world.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Share of highly multidisciplinary publications: </strong>This measures the extent to which authors from different disciplines collaborate on research projects. It reflects the diversity of the prior disciplinary backgrounds of a paper&rsquo;s co-authors and is calculated to account for the number of distinct disciplines, the cognitive distance that separates them, and the balance between them. A paper co-authored by authors whose previous papers were distributed across subfields of science in a similar pattern would score lower than papers bringing together authors with different backgrounds even if those authors, individually, have published in a less diverse set of subfields. Share of highly multidisciplinary (with high disciplinary diversity of authors - DDA) publications refers to the share of an entity&rsquo;s papers among the top 10% with the highest DDA in the world.</li>

        <h2><strong>Open Access</strong> indicators</h2>
        <p><strong>Share of publications available in open access</strong> is the percentage of research outputs that are available online, free of access charges or other barriers. Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. It is computed for OA overall as well as by type of open access, using data from Unpaywall.</p>
        <p>There are different models of open access (OA) publishing:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>In <strong>Hybrid</strong> and <strong>Gold</strong> OA, the publisher makes all articles and related content freely available to read at the time of publication.</li>
        <li><strong>Green</strong> OA articles are available in an OA repository, independently from publication by a publisher.&nbsp;<em>Note that Green OA may be affected by the &ldquo;embargo effect&rdquo; because many journal publishers do not allow authors to post their publication in an OA repository until a certain amount of time has gone by. This effect usually exerts its strongest influence on the two most recent publication years.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Bronze </strong>OA refers to articles that are freely available but do not have a clearly identifiable license.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>OA color for this indicator is defined according to the best OA location where a document is retrieved. For more details about how OA colors are defined, please refer to the <a href="https://support.unpaywall.org/support/solutions/articles/44001777288-what-do-the-types-of-oa-status-green-gold-hybrid-and-bronze-mean-" target="_blank">Unpaywall definitions</a>.</p>

The World FWCI is indexed to a value of 1.0, meaning that values above 1.0 indicate above average citation impact. For example, a value of 1.7 indicates a citation impact that is 1.7 times the average or 70% above average.</li>

        <h2><strong>Authorship </strong>indicator and gender inference</h2>
        <p><strong>Share of author count</strong> <strong>by gender</strong> is the share of authors who are women or men. To infer a gender from an author&rsquo;s name, Elsevier employs an approach that combines the use of existing and established name/gender lists and the use of Namsor, designed to determine the gender of names, taking into account different elements such as given name, surname, ethnicity and country. The indicator has known limitations for Asian names. In this dashboard we have limited the data to those countries with sufficient numbers of researchers, and a sufficient quality for inferred gender. For more details refer to the report.</p>
        <p><strong>For a discussion of this approach and its limitations, </strong>see: 2018: <a href="http://www.science-metrix.com/sites/default/files/science-metrix/publications/science-metrix_bibliometric_indicators_womens_contribution_to_science_report.pdf" target="_blank">science-metrix_bibliometric_indicators_womens_contribution_to_science_report.pdf</a> (Science-Metrix.com)</p>

        <h2>Subject areas and subfields included in the analysis:</h2>
        <p>Titles in Scopus are classified under four broad subject clusters (life sciences, physical sciences, health sciences and social sciences &amp; humanities), which are further divided into 27 major subject areas (known as All Science Journal Classification or ASJC). Titles may belong to more than one subject area. Subject areas in this report are based on 26 subject areas, with titles classified as &ldquo;Multidisciplinary&rdquo; by ASJC reclassified for this report.</p>
        <p><strong>To define subfields of research within medicine, we leveraged a system in which the major subfields of medicine are further classified into subcategories. </strong>Because there is considerable overlap in some subcategories, we defined medicine subfields by grouping the appropriate subcategories based on the frequency that publications were categorized in overlapping subcategories. For example, we created the subfield &ldquo;Fertility &amp; Birth&rdquo; because a high percentage of publications in the subcategory &ldquo;Obstetrics and Gynecology&rdquo; were also classified in the subcategory &ldquo;Reproductive Medicine&rdquo;. The final selection of research subfields in medicine is shown here.</p>
